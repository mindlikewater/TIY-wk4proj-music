# Summary

This is a music app I created using Soundcloud's API.  My project can be found here:
[Tai's Music Search App](http://tiy-mikaelchen-wk4proj-soundcloud.surge.sh).

# Objectives

- Get a better understanding of how to read API documentation and make use of it

- Become familiar with making AJAX requests and dealing with the response

- Learn how to handle empty values (for example, how to handle missing images?)

- Learned how to add special effects (rotating button, hover effects)

# Tools

For this project, I used:

- Soundcloud API

- Lodash for sorting music files alphabetically
